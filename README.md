# SetThemeKDE
My first script :D

**A tool I created to change the wallpaper, folder colour and colour theme in the terminal, all in one script. (Only works in KDE)**

Make sure your wallpapers are in ~/Pictures/Wallpapers or change the directory in the script.

Make sure you have papirus-folders installed so that the script can change the folder colour.

Make sure you have Pywal installed so that my script can change the terminal colours.

**How to install:**

1. Install the dependencies below.
2. Clone this repo/download the script
3. Run the script
4. (Optional) Add a alias to your shell's config file to run this script when you type in a command.

**Dependencies:**
Pywal
