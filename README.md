# SetThemeKDE
My first script :D

**A tool I created to change the wallpaper, folder colour and colour theme in the terminal, all in one script. (Only works in KDE)**


**Dependencies:**
Pywal

Papirus-folders (https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-folders)

Make sure your wallpapers are in ~/Pictures/Wallpapers or change the directory in the script.

Make sure you have papirus-folders installed so that the script can change the folder colour.

Make sure you have Pywal installed so that my script can change the terminal colours.
